    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>On July 27th, 2014 in Ravnogor was held the Second International Amateur Folklore Festival. It was organised again by Nina Gruncharova, who lives in Stockholm, Sweden. A composite choir "Kuriosa" /guests of the hotel "Boryka"/ participated in the festival featuring singers from Sweden, Finland, Norway and Turkmenistan. The choir is headed by Karin Bjurvald and had Maria Leshkova as a guest-conductor. The soloists performed choral works in Swedish and folklore songs in Bulgarian. They presented typic Bulgarian dances taught by the freelance composer and musician Michail Dinchev. Georg Schubert from Hungary proved his mastery of the bagpipe. In the celebration actively took part the "Folklore Group at the National Cultural Center April 23th, 1876" and the church choir of Ravnogor, the Cultural Centers of Skutare and Rozovo, as well as bagpipers and singers from the towns of Peshtera and Bratsigovo</value>

    <value>The village of Ravnogor is located at 1350 metres above sea level in the area of Batak in the north-western Rhodope Mauntains. The peak Sveta Nedelia soars just above it. Climbing up its steep slopes, you can see the magnificent view that reveals. In the west, you can clearly see the village and the entire Ravnogorian plateau with its potato fields and forests. In the north there is the Trakia lowland and in the east and south stretch the Rhodopes. The deeply dug valley of river Vucha is clearly outlined and beyond it there is the mountain of Chernatitza with its peaks Modur and Persenk. The village was established upon the lands of the ancient Thracians, proof of which are the mounds, located in its territory. Its first name dates back from the time of the Ottoman slavery – the village was called Koria (meaning literally ‘forest’) and it gets its name with the acknowledgment of the village as an administrative unit in the Turkish empire in 1777. For the sake of the fact that the Turks did not manage to convert the then inhabitants to Mohammedanism, they called them ‘aksis’ (meaning ‘bad people’), and the village – Aksi Koria.</value>

  <data name="LocalityP2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>After the liberation of Bulgaria with a decision of the municipal council the name of the village is changed to Iasu Koria (meaning ‘flat forest’). It was kept till 1934 when by a government decree it is replaced with the current name – Ravnogor (which is the Bulgarian equivalent of ‘flat forest’). At that time the main means of living were field farming and stock-breeding. Oats, rye, peas, vetch, beans, maize, lentil and potatoes were cultivated. Among the animals the biggest importance had goats, horses and cows.</value>

  <data name="LocalityP3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The territory of the village is 92 000 decars. Its frontiers are in the north-east – the lands of the village of Zhrebichko, in the east – the banks of river Vucha, in the south – the lands of the village of Fotinovo, in the south-west – the lands of the village of Nova Mahala, in the south-west – the lands of Rozovo village and the town of Bratzigovo.</value>

  <data name="PotatoBody" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Potatoes are the main cultivation in Ravnogor and means of living for the inhabitants. From old times the village is recognized as a centre of eco-production of potatoes for southern Bulgaria. The seed-producing farm which existed here until 1990 and was one of the biggest in Bulgaria has contributed for the good reputation of the local production. At the present moment the village is well-known throughout the country with the ecologically pure potatoes produced here. The celebration exists scarcely from the autumn of 2005 but from now on it will carry out through the last Friday of October. It consists of presentation of potatoes, specific dishes and decoration of them. For the best performed in the categories people there are rewards, too.</value>
